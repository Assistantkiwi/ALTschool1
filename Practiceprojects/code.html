    <h1>Why water is important to life.</h1>
    <p>Water makes up about <b>75%</b> of the body composition, <br /> therefore this shows that we as humans can't do without it.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Composition of water.</h2>
    <p>Water is made up of 2 parts of <b>Hydrogen</b>(H<sub>2</sub>) and 1 part of <b>Oxygen</b>(O) <br />  i.e H<sub>2</sub>+ O = H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Forms of water.</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Blood</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
        <li>Snow</li>

<h4>Compositon of Human Blood</h4>
<p>The human body is filled with blood <strong>(which is made up of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.)</strong> <br /> which is responsible for all the transmissions and movement of the body nutrients and excretions to and fro, around the body</p>
<p><cite> <strong>Blood is comprised of two main components; Plasma and the Cellular components. <br /> Plasma makes up 55% of total blood volume, while the cellular componenets form 45%</strong>  </cite></p>
<p>The cellular components of blood consist of a number of different blood cells or cell fragments, including <strong>Red blood cells, White blood cells, and Platelets.</strong> </p>
<p>The following table provides a summary of the important characteristics of the cellular components of blood:</p>
<table border="2">
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Lifespan</th>
        <th>Function</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Red Blood Cells</th>
        <td>120 days</td>
        <td>Oxygen transport,<br /> gas exchange.</td>
        <td>40-45%</td>

    <tr>

        <td>1 day or <br /> less</td>
        <td>Immune function</td>
        <td>0.7-1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Platelets</th>
        <td>10 days</td>
        <td>Blood clot <br /> formation</td>
        <td><1%</td>
